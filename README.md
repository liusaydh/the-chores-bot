# HRH The Chores Bot
A Discord bot that gives you chores to do.
<br>

Presenting HRH (His Royal Highness) The Chores Bot. This is a very simple Discord bot written over the course of 2 hours which randomly generates small chores for me.
It is currently set to generate three chores that can be done in the room being mentioned.
<br>

So, for example, if I type "kitchen" in my empty server, it gives three random chores that can be done. Since 26/11, the code is set that one needs to type /kitchen. So, it no longer recognises part of a message, which might also be annoying in casual conversation, but actually requires you to trigger a command to get the output.
<br>

## What I want to do with this eventually <br>

~~Have built-in commands (preferably slash commands).~~ DONE <br>
 1. Be able to choose a certain number of random chores to be output. <br>
 2. Possibly have a combination of chores from multiple lists (a pre-set number). <br>
~~Make the output nicer, such as "In the kitchen, today you should:" and then have it be a list of chores.~~ DONE <br>
 3. Write a help instance. <br>
~~No duplicates.~~ DONE
