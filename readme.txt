Presenting HRH (His Royal Highness) The Chores Bot. This is a very simple Discord bot written over the course of 2 hours which randomly generates small chores for me.
It is currently set to generate three chores that can be done in the room being mentioned.

So, for example, if I type "kitchen" in my empty server, it gives three random chores that can be done.

What I want to do with this eventually is:
	- have build-in commands (preferably slash commands)
	- be able to choose a certain number of random chores to be output
	- possibly have a combination of chores from multiple lists (a pre-set number)
